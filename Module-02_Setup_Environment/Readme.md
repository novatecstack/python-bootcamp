# Setting up the environment for developing apps with Python

To get started, we need below applications:
  - Python installer
  - IDE (Pycharm/Spyder/IntelliJ)

## 1. Install and Configure Python
   - Python supports all the OS platforms:
     - Windows
     - Linux
     - MacOS
   - Minimum system requirement for Python installation
     - **Operating System**
       - Windows 8 (or above)
       - Linux RHEL 6/7, 64-bit | Ubuntu
       - Mac OS X 10.11 or higher, 64-bit
     - **Processor**: x86 64-bit CPU (Intel/AMD)
     - **Memory**: 4 GB RAM 
     - **Storage**: 20 GB free disk space  
   
### [1.1 Install Python using `Python Installer`](https://www.python.org/)
   - Download and Install the latest version of Python as per your system's OS:
     - [Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
     - [Linux](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/)
     - [MacOS](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)
   - To verify the python installation, go to start menu >> Command prompt >> and run command `python --version` and see if returns current installed version of python.
   - When you install Python, there are some other programs also which gets installed namely:
     - Python Shell
     - IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment)

### [1.2 Install Python using `Anaconda distribution`](https://www.anaconda.com/)
  - The Anaconda distribution comes with Python interpreter, Jupyter notebook and many Python libraries.
     
## 2. Install IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
   - You may install any of the below IDE (editors) for developing python apps:
     - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
     - [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/eclipseide/)
     - [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
     - [Atom](https://atom.en.uptodown.com/windows)
     - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)   
   - Once you're done with the IDE (PyCharm) installation, you need to configure two things:
     - Base Interpreter (Python 3.x in our case)
     - Enable Reformat code/file settings
