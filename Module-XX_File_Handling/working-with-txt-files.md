   ```
   # Opening a text file in read-only mode
   fileObj = open("samplefile.txt","r")

   ```

## Reading a Text file using Python
   
   ```
   fileObj = open("samplefile.txt","r")

   # Reading complete text file
   print(fileobj.read())

   # Reading one line at a time (starting from 1st line)
   print(fileObj.readline())

   # Read the text file by traversing through all the lines one by one
   for i in fileObj:
     print(i)

   ```
