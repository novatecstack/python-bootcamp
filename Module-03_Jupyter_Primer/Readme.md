# Jupyter Overview
  - Jupyter is a large umbrella project that covers many different software offerings and tools, including the popular `Jupyter Notebook` and `JupyterLab` web-based notebook authoring and editing applications. 
  - The Jupyter project and its subprojects all center around providing tools (and standards) for interactive computing with computational notebooks.

## What is a Notebook?
   - A `notebook` is a shareable document that combines computer code, plain language descriptions, data, rich visualizations like 3D models, charts, graphs and figures, and interactive controls. 
   - A `notebook`, along with an editor (like JupyterLab), provides a fast interactive environment for prototyping and explaining code, exploring and visualizing data, and sharing ideas with others.
