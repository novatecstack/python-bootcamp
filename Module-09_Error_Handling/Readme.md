# Understand how to handle errors in Python

In this module, we will discuss how to handle exceptions in Python using `try`, `except`, and `finally` statements with the help of examples.   

In python, there could be basically two types of errors:
    1) Syntax Errors
    2) Exception Errors

## Advantages of handling Exceptions in the program
   - Clean code
   - Easier debugging
   - Easier to read & maintain the code
   - Better application reliability
   - Better end-user experience

## [Different types of Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html)
   - In Python, there are various built-in exceptions that can be raised when an error occur while executing a program.
   - Here are some of the most common types of Python exceptions:
     - NameError
     - SyntaxError
     - TypeError
     - IndexError
     - KeyError
     - ValueError
     - IOError
