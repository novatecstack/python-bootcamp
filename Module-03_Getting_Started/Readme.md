# Getting started with the `Python`

In this module, we will explore some of the basic concepts of Python:
  - Introduction to Python IDLE and Python Shell
  - Working with Python's `print()` function
  - Write your first Python script
  - Learn what happens when you run a script with an error
  - Understanding Python statements
  - Adding comments in Python
  - Exploring Python Variables
  - Exploring Python variable data types

## 1. Introduction to `Python IDLE` and `Python Shell`

## 2. Working with `print()` function

## 3. Understanding `Statements`
   
## 4. Python Comments

## 5. Exploring `Python Variables`
  
## 6. Exploring `Python Data Types`
   - There are various data types avaiable in python:
     - Strings
     - Number
     - Lists
     - Sets
     - Tuples
     - Dictionaries

## What is an Object in Python?
   - As we now know that Python is an object-oriented programming language, everything is in Python treated as an object, including variable, function, list, tuple, dictionary, etc.
   - Every object belongs to its class.
   - **Example**: An *integer variable* belongs to *integer class*.


## [Python built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
The Python has many built-in functions which are always available to you and you can use on the fly anywhere in your logic without explicitly importing any packages.

### Print a message or variable value on the standard output
[print()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=built%20functions#print)


### Getting the input from the user
[input()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=built%20functions#input)
