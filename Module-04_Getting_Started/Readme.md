# Getting started with the `Python`

In this module, we will explore some of the basic concepts of Python:
  - Introduction to Python IDLE and Python Shell
  - Working with Python's `print()` function
  - Write your first Python script
  - Learn what happens when you run a script with an error
  - Python Indentation
  - Adding comments in Python
  - Exploring Python Variables
  - Exploring Python variable data types

## 1. Introduction to `Python IDLE` and `Python Shell`

## 2. Working with `print()` function

## 3. Python Indentation
   - Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
   - Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
     
     ```
      if 10 > 5:
        print("Ten is greater than five.")
     ```
   - Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation.
   - The number of spaces is up to you, the most common use is four spaces, but it has to be at least one.
   - You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code

## 4. Python Comments
   - Comments can be used to explain Python code.
   - It is usually used to make the code more readable.
   - Comments are ignored while compilation of the code.
   - Python comments are annotated with `#` character
   - Example:
      ```
      # This is a comment
      print("Hello world!")

      print("Hello world!")  # This is a comment
      ```
   - For multiline comments, you could insert `#` character for each line or triple quotes.
   
## 5. Exploring `Python Variables`
  
## 6. Exploring `Python Data Types`
   - There are various data types avaiable in python:
     - Strings
     - Number
     - Lists
     - Sets
     - Tuples
     - Dictionaries

## What is an Object in Python?
   - As we now know that Python is an object-oriented programming language, everything is in Python treated as an object, including variable, function, list, tuple, dictionary, etc.
   - Every object belongs to its class.
   - **Example**: An *integer variable* belongs to *integer class*.


## [Python built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
The Python has many built-in functions which are always available to you and you can use on the fly anywhere in your logic without explicitly importing any packages.

### Print a message or variable value on the standard output
[print()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=built%20functions#print)


### Getting the input from the user
[input()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=built%20functions#input)
